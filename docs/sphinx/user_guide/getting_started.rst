Getting started with Radiuss-Clingo-Install
*******************************************

Radiuss-Clingo-Install is a CI only repo installing Clingo on LC systems for a
given user. It leverages GitLab capabilities to automate complex actions while
allowing easy customization and user-friendly visual rendering in the UI.

Radiuss-Clingo-Install is meant to run on LC GitLab instance. The main repo,
hosted on GitHub for accessibility and visibility, is mirrored on LC GitLab for
testing and/or running specific configurations on demand.

No installation is required. Instead, one may either clone the project in their
own LC Gitlab space, or create a specific branch in the original GitHub repo.

.. note::
   We prefer that projects share their configuration by contributing to the
   GitHub repo but this is not mandatory.

Private clone or contribution branch
====================================

Cloning Radiuss-Clingo-Install
==============================

Repository setup
----------------

Radiuss-Clingo-Install is meant to run on LC Gitlab. Projects may choose to
maintain their own clone. A simple pull and push clone from your local machine
should suffice:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ git clone git@github.com:LLNL/radiuss-clingo-install.git
  $ git remote add gitlab ssh://git@czgitlab.llnl.gov:7999/<group>/radiuss-clingo-install.git
  $ git push gitlab

Create a branch in the GitHub repo
==================================

Requirements
------------

We welcome LLNL projects, in particular RADIUSS supported projects, to
contribute their configuration directly to the GitHub repo. To do so, one
should:

* Request write access to the GitHub repo.
* Submit a PR with their configuration.
* Make sure the configuration is working (see usage section).

.. note::
   It is mandatory that `CI_CONFIG_FILE` remains undefined on the main branch.
   In facts, per our CI configuration, we impose that it be defined in GitLab
   UI. In the UI, it is then possible to trigger or schedule pipelines with
   define `CI_CONFIG_FILE` set to the path of the desired configuration.

.. note::
   Only PRs originating from the GitHub repo can be mirrored on LC GitLab, no
   PR from forks can be tested. Please request write access.

Configuration file
==================

All the parameters are gathered in `configs/<config-name>.yml`.

 ======================== ====================================================== ===========
  Parameter                Description                                           Default
 ======================== ====================================================== ===========
  ``LLNL_SERVICE_USER``    Service Account used in CI                             __none__
  ``CUSTOM_CI_BUILD_DIR``  Where to locate build directories (prevent overquota)  __none__
  ``CI_SPACK_PATH``        Where to clone Spack, used to share a unique instance  `./spack`
  ``CI_SPACK_REPO``        Repository to clone Spack from                         __none__
  ``CI_SPACK_REF``         Reference (branch, commit) to clone in Spack history   __none__
 ======================== ====================================================== ===========

Important note about service accounts
=====================================

We strongly recommend to manage Clingo install using a service account. In
facts that is the only way to get the install working reliably for CI use of
Spack.

By default CLingo is installed in ``~/.spack/bootstrap/store``, in the user's
home directory.  Using a service account to install Clingo and then that same
service account to run Spack will ensure that Clingo is already installed
whoever is asking for it.


=====
Usage
=====

The goal of this project is to install Clingo on demand. We don't want to
re-install Clingo each time a commit is pushed to a branch.

We configured the CI so that by default GitLab will run a single job notifying
the user that no configuration file was provided.

Installing Clingo using your configuration
==========================================

In order to effectively trigger the Clingo installation, one needs to set
`CI_CONFIG_FILE` to point to the desired configuration. This can only be done
in Gitlab UI.

Triggering a pipeline manually
------------------------------

To simply perform a one-time install, go to `CI-CD/Pipelines` and hit `Run
pipeline`.  GitLab opens a page where you can pick the branch you would like to
use, and specify variables for the pipeline: this is where you can set
`CI_CONFIG_FILE` with your configuration. Hit `Run pipeline` and the pipeline
starts immediately, effectively installing Clingo with your configuration.

Schedule a recurring pipeline
-----------------------------

Another usage can be to test on a regular basis that Clingo keeps installing
without errors with the latest Spack.

First, we need a new configuration file with `CI_SPACK_REF` set to `develop`.
Then we go to `CI-CD/Schedules` and define a new schedule. Pick a branch, set
`CI_CONFIG_FILE` with the new configuration, and choose a recurrence using the
cron syntax. Hit `Save pipeline schedule` and your pipeline will start at the
next defined recurrence.
