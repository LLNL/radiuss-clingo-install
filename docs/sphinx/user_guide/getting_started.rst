Getting started with Radiuss Clingo Install
*******************************************

Radiuss Clingo Install is a CI only repo. It consists in using GitLab CI
capabilities in order to automate complex actions while allowing easy
customization and user-friendly visual rendering in the UI.

Radiuss Clingo Install is meant to run on LC GitLab instance. The main repo,
hosted on GitHub for accessibility and visibility, is mirrored on LC GitLab to
provide a testing framework.

No build is required. Instead, one may either setup a personal / project owned
GitLab repository where Radiuss Clingo Install will be cloned and tuned or
create a project specific branch in the GitHub origin repo. There is not
preferred solution at this stage.
