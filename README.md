# RADIUSS Clingo Install

The RADIUSS project promotes and supports key High Performance Computing (HPC)
open-source software developed at the LLNL. These tools and libraries cover a
wide range of features a team would need to develop a modern simulation code
targeting HPC plaftorms.

RADIUSS Clingo Install is a sub-project from the RADIUSS initiative providing a
testing infrastructure to test that clingo installs correctly on any LC machine
of interest. It does so automatically in GitLab while tracking changes in
Spack.

that consists in installing spack from scratch and perform a simple
concretization that will install clingo.
